NARRATOR|"Becca's reflection wavered gently on the curved observation window, Earth stretching out behind her like a luminous painting—vast, alive, and impossibly close."
NARRATOR|"Sweeping arcs of ocean and cloud filled the frame, the surface split cleanly between day and night."
NARRATOR|"On one side, sunrise crept across the curve of the planet, gilding the edge in soft gold."
NARRATOR|"On the other, darkness clung to the land like a heavy veil, broken by the scattered shimmer of city lights—tiny clusters of life still blinking in the dark."
NARRATOR|"Beyond that lay the void cloaking the other worlds—planets, moons, and stars by the billions—but none, as far as anyone could prove, carried life."
NARRATOR|"Not like this one."
NARRATOR|"And yet, if she stared long enough into that darkness, she could find the faintest signs of it."
NARRATOR|"Tiny pulses of light, scattered at impossible distances, marked the presence of other stations—quiet shapes drifting in low orbit, caught in Earth's gravity like Polaris."
NARRATOR|"One of those pulses appeared just above the horizon, faint but unwavering."
NARRATOR|"Becca knew it by position alone—Europa Station."
NARRATOR|"Six kilometers long and layered like a stack of mismatched modules, it was the largest and oldest of the twelve orbiting stations."
NARRATOR|"From here, it was nothing more than a pinprick of light, no brighter than an aircraft blinking through distant clouds."
NARRATOR|"Six minutes since Europa last blinked—she had timed it."
NARRATOR|"She fixed her gaze on the dark edge of the horizon and waited."
NARRATOR|"The seconds stretched, one by one, like the ticking of a clock she couldn't hear."
NARRATOR|"Her breath ghosted faintly on the glass."
[PAUSE=0.3]
NARRATOR|"There."
NARRATOR|"A small flare of light blinked into existence."
NARRATOR|"Europa, right on time."
NARRATOR|"She let her gaze follow the slow, steady arc the station made along its orbit."
CHRIS|"... Becca can walk you through how Allie optimized the final set of decision branches."
NARRATOR|"The sound of her name snapped her back."
NARRATOR|"She blinked at the monitor across the bench—Chris was still talking, and she'd been staring out the window for who knew how long."
NARRATOR|"The LED beside her webcam was glowing. On. Definitely on."
NARRATOR|"She clicked through the meeting's participant list until she found her own feed."
NARRATOR|"The image was unforgivingly clear."
NARRATOR|"Pale skin, faint shadows under her eyes, her auburn hair pulled into a loose bun with a few rebellious strands curling along her temple."
NARRATOR|"Even the soft glow from overheads didn't hide the tiredness etched in the lines around her eyes."
NARRATOR|"Her focus seemed to sit just behind her eyes instead of in them."
CHRIS|"...Becca?"
NARRATOR|"She toggled her mic on, forcing the corners of her mouth upward."
BECCA|"Right. Thanks, Chris."
NARRATOR|"Becca rubbed her temple, feeling the familiar ache building behind her eyes."
BECCA|"As of this morning, Allie completed the final integrity checks on the adaptive decision matrix. We're holding at an error rate of point-zero-two percent."
NARRATOR|"She glanced at the telemetry display hovering just out of frame, numbers scrolling past in neat columns."
NARRATOR|"Each one was going to be a person. And if the model failed..."
BECCA|"In environmental hazard simulations, Allie correctly identified safe evacuation paths in ninety-nine point nine percent of test scenarios, even with incomplete data."
NARRATOR|"She paused, watching Wu's expression in the corner tile."
BECCA|"That's an improvement from last month."
WU|"What about the solar flare scenario?"
NARRATOR|"Wu cut in, his voice sharp."
NARRATOR|"Becca's jaw tightened."
BECCA|"That was one failure in thousands of runs. We're adjusting the decision weighting—"
WU|"One failure could mean a dozen dead crew members."
NARRATOR|"The words hung in the silence."
NARRATOR|"Becca stared at Wu's tile, then at the scrolling data beside her notes."
BECCA|"When someone's dying in a hab failure, Allie won't have time to ask for more data. She needs to make the right call with whatever she has."
NARRATOR|"Her voice stayed level, professional, but her knuckles had gone white where she gripped the edge of her desk."
BECCA|"That's what the adaptive matrix does—fills in the blanks and still lands on the right answer."
BECCA|"The goal is for Allie to handle situations where humans don't have time to deliberate. Life-or-death decisions in seconds, not minutes."
NARRATOR|"She knew survival zones was more accurate, but field sounded less threatening."
BECCA|"We're also beginning integration with the biological adaptation parameters from the serum trials."
NARRATOR|"Becca shifted in her chair, glancing at test logs that made her stomach clench."
BECCA|"Allie's starting to anticipate what people will be capable of after enhancement—extended radiation tolerance, altered metabolic rates, higher oxygen efficiency. She's planning for what's possible, not just what's probable."
CHRIS|"And the cleaner those simulations get, the easier it is to make the case for a surface mission. No one's signing off on descent until they're convinced we can get people back up alive."
NARRATOR|"He paused, and Becca caught the faint sound of him drumming his fingers—a nervous habit she'd noticed in a dozen meetings."
CHRIS|"Though I suppose dying heroically on an alien world beats dying slowly in committee."
NARRATOR|"A few uncomfortable chuckles rippled through the channel before silence settled."
NARRATOR|"The kind that wasn't quite agreement, but no one wanted to challenge on record."
MEETING_VOICES|"Right."
NARRATOR|"A voice finally said—neutral, noncommittal."
MEETING_VOICES|"Moving on. Budget allocations"
NARRATOR|"The chair announced."
NARRATOR|"Becca muted her mic and leaned back in her chair, feeling the tension settle between her shoulder blades."
NARRATOR|"Outside the window, Europa had already slipped out of sight, leaving nothing but the curve of the planet and the dark beyond."
WU|"Environmental model expansion requires a six-point-four percent increase to maintain current timelines."
NARRATOR|"Wu's voice cut through the budget discussion, clipped and precise."
WU|"Seven percent is aggressive, yes—but fuel reserves are already impacted by the vendor switch after Brazil suspended export licenses last quarter. Until that embargo is lifted, propulsion will need alternate suppliers."
MEETING_VOICES|"Sanctions are piling up. Pacific Coalition's already cutting shipments. How long before it's metals, or water?"
NARRATOR|"Someone from propulsion muttered."
NARRATOR|"Ten percent more won't be enough, Becca thought, watching the speaking icons flare and fade across her screen."
NARRATOR|"Every credit cut from the environmental model was one less hazard scenario she could test."
NARRATOR|"One less blind spot closed before someone bet their life on the results."
NARRATOR|"The rest was numbers, contracts, margins. None of it mattered if the models failed."
NARRATOR|"Becca half-listened, her gaze drifting back to the window."
NARRATOR|"Some clusters of city lights glowed brighter than ever, others were dark where millions still lived."
NARRATOR|"Power grids failing, patchwork repairs. The map of Earth was becoming uneven."
NARRATOR|"Europa would be welcoming new arrivals even now—contractors, tourists, families."
NARRATOR|"Life kept flowing into orbit while she was still trying to prove it could survive there."
MEETING_VOICES|"That's all for today."
NARRATOR|"One by one, the tiles began winking out—names and faces disappearing into black squares."
NARRATOR|"Becca waited until the last few were gone before killing her own feed."
NARRATOR|"The sudden quiet felt heavier without the constant murmur of voices."
NARRATOR|"She let her head fall back against the chair, eyes closing."
NARRATOR|"Outside the observation window, Earth continued its slow rotation, carrying day into night and back again."
NARRATOR|"The planet spun on, steady and eternal."
NARRATOR|"Becca, by contrast, felt like she was running out of time."
NARRATOR|"The hum of the station pressed in around her—steady, low, almost lulling."
NARRATOR|"For the first time all day, she didn't fight it."
