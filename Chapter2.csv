That's a great approach to tidying up a draft! I've removed all the `[PAUSE=X]` lines and what appears to be a full chapter's worth of content that was repeating (the portion covering their time in the cabin).

Here is the cleaned-up draft for Chapter 2, focusing on their arrival at Europa Station:

## Chapter 2 Draft - Cleaned

NARRATOR|"The docking collar gave a soft metallic shudder, then the hatch rotated open with a deliberate hiss."
NARRATOR|"Warm air spilled into the shuttle, carrying the faint scent of ozone and something green—hydroponic air, richer and cleaner than anything they'd breathed in days."
NARRATOR|"One by one, passengers filed out, boots clinking against the deck plating of Europa Station's arrival concourse."
NARRATOR|"And then she stepped through."
NARRATOR|"Her hair—a deep chestnut catching glints of auburn in the station lights—fell in loose waves down her back."
NARRATOR|"A cream-colored travel dress cinched at the waist and flared at the knee, the fabric floating with a grace meant for zero-g."
NARRATOR|"In the crook of one arm she clutched a small purse; the other she flung wide as she tilted her head toward the vaulted glass ceiling."
NARRATOR|"Earth loomed beyond it—luminous blues and whites, the curve so near it seemed close enough to touch."
NARRATOR|"She breathed in like she meant to swallow the sky."
NARRATOR|"A smile broke across her face, unguarded and bright, before she spun once, the hem of her dress tracing a slow comet."
NARRATOR|"Her laugh—clear, lilting, touched with the Riviera—carried across the concourse."
MARA|"Bébé, eet's beautiful. Come, hurry."
NARRATOR|"She breathed, vowels curling like ribbon."
NARRATOR|"He stepped after her in a dark travel suit, jacket easy at the shoulders, a pale shirt open at the collar."
NARRATOR|"A narrow-brimmed hat shadowed his eyes, but the grin was all warmth."
NARRATOR|"He followed her gaze upward."
NARRATOR|"Europa stretched around them like a cathedral turned inside out—ribbed beams arcing to glass that held back the black."
NARRATOR|"Overhead, gardens unfurled in terraces, green upon green."
NARRATOR|"Banners from a dozen nations lifted and fell in the recycled breeze."
JONAH|"Not as beautiful as y'are, love."
NARRATOR|"He said, cupping her hand and dipping her into a kiss that ignored the weary shuffle of passengers around them."
NARRATOR|"A pair sidestepped with a muttered sigh. The couple didn't notice."
NARRATOR|"They lingered a heartbeat longer than polite society allowed, then straightened, fingers still twined."
NARRATOR|"Together they stepped into the current of travelers."
NARRATOR|"The hum beneath their feet steadied—the pulse of maglev lines running under the deck."
NARRATOR|"Somewhere a tram whooshed past, its vibration rippling faintly through the plating."
NARRATOR|"Above, spectrum-balanced lamps tracked in slow arcs, mimicking Earth's rotation."
NARRATOR|"The place was alive: voices in a dozen accents, the chime of boarding calls, the hiss of a vendor cart steaming fresh bread."
NARRATOR|"Yeast and greenery tangled with the tang of sterilized metal, settling into something uniquely orbital."
NARRATOR|"They had arrived."
JONAH|"Left or right?"
NARRATOR|"He asked, though the overhead signs were clear."
MARA|"Left. More windows."
JONAH|"You don't know that."
MARA|"I do. I can smell the light."
NARRATOR|"She said, conspiratorial."
NARRATOR|"He laughed."
JONAH|"That's not how light works, Mara."
MARA|"It is if you're growing basil."
NARRATOR|"She tipped her chin at the terrace overhead."
MARA|"See the droop? That row gets shade on the half-hour. They'll shift the lamps."
JONAH|"Expert testimony. Remind me again why we picked Europa?"
NARRATOR|"She squeezed his hand."
MARA|"Because you wanted to see how they hide ductwork and I wanted to see how they hide roots."
JONAH|"Slur the word 'ductwork' like that again and I'm carrying you to Quarantine."
NARRATOR|"She laughed, then slowed, looking—not at the grand things, but the small: the bevel on a pressure door, how a cleaner bot tucked itself into a gap between benches, the faint condensation line under a window seam."
NARRATOR|"He watched her watching, content with the reflection of Earth in the glass and the reflection of her in his periphery."
MARA|"Your ring."
NARRATOR|"She said softly."
NARRATOR|"He looked down. His fingers had found the band without him noticing, twisting it. He let go, sheepish."
JONAH|"Still getting used to it."
MARA|"You'll dent it into a hexagon."
JONAH|"I like hexagons. Strongest packing pattern."
MARA|"You're impossible."
JONAH|"Marry an engineer, suffer the consequences."
MARA|"I married Jonah."
NARRATOR|"She said, and kissed his knuckles where they'd gone still."
NARRATOR|"Processing was a few turns ahead, marked by a sweep of frosted glass and an arc of line posts."
NARRATOR|"The queue drifted at a steady pace."
NARRATOR|"Overhead, a departure board cycled destinations: AGR-3, Medical, Dock C, Upper Gardens, Residency."
NARRATOR|"A child pressed a nose to the glass and fogged a perfect circle; his mother pulled him back with a smile and a gentle scold in Portuguese."
NARRATOR|"Mara watched the gardens on the mezzanine."
NARRATOR|"Every so often, a worker in a pale coverall reached up and pinched the tip of a leaf, testing for stress."
NARRATOR|"She smiled."
JONAH|"You're thinking about your grandmother's terrace."
MARA|"Maybe. She used to say you can taste when a plant is listening."
JONAH|"Again, not how plants work."
MARA|"She was right, though."
JONAH|"Was she right about putting mint in everything?"
MARA|"She was right about everything."
JONAH|"Except the mint."
NARRATOR|"She elbowed him, gentle."
NARRATOR|"A maintenance crew in orange vests had one panel off along the ceiling track."
NARRATOR|"A smell like hot dust threaded the air—nothing alarming, just the tang of electronics."
NARRATOR|"A tech on a ladder tapped a sensor cradle with the handle of a tool."
TECH|"Again."
NARRATOR|"He said, and someone below him flipped a switch."
NARRATOR|"The lamps along one span flickered once—twice—then steadied at a fraction brighter."
NARRATOR|"A nearby placard read, almost cheerful: 'Routine atmospheric adjustment.'"
NARRATOR|"In the queue, their line slowed."
NARRATOR|"A clerk leaned toward his terminal, frowning."
CLERK|"New protocols. Just a moment."
NARRATOR|"He told a weary man with a carryall."
PASSENGER|"Sanctions again? Berlin won't move shipments until the Pacific embargo lifts."
NARRATOR|"Someone muttered two places back in line."
NARRATOR|"Jonah caught Mara's eye and shrugged."
JONAH|"Politics follows you everywhere. Even six hundred kilometers up."
NARRATOR|"She rolled her eyes, already tugging him forward."
NARRATOR|"Mara's gaze drifted to a small knot of uniforms moving down the concourse—station security, not military."
NARRATOR|"Calm faces. No hurry."
NARRATOR|"Still, the crowd adjusted—people made space, eyes flicked and then politely didn't."
NARRATOR|"A vendor, mid-pitch, lowered his voice."
BACKGROUND_VOICE|"—told Berlin the fuel shipments are delayed again—"
NARRATOR|"Floated from somewhere behind them, cut off by the hiss of a passing cart."
JONAH|"Supply chain things. Boring station business."
NARRATOR|"Jonah said, more to fill the air than to answer anything."
NARRATOR|"Mara nodded and leaned into his shoulder, unconcerned."
NARRATOR|"The line hummed forward."
NARRATOR|"A clerk scanned their passes and stamped each one with a quiet chime."
CLERK|"Welcome to Europa. Residency sector L-3, viewport corridor. Lifts to your right."
NARRATOR|"He said, accent clipped Berlin, smile mechanical but not unkind."
MARA|"Viewport."
NARRATOR|"Mara mouthed, delighted."
JONAH|"Viewport."
NARRATOR|"Jonah echoed, already imagining how the glass was mounted, whether the pressure frames were composite or old-fashioned alloy. He kept that to himself."
PA_SYSTEM|"Attention residents and visitors: routine inspections are currently underway in Docking Sector A. Please expect extended processing times. This is a precautionary measure only. We thank you for your patience. Visitors are reminded that diplomatic clearances may affect transport schedules."
NARRATOR|"A PA announcement chimed softly."
NARRATOR|"As they stepped away, one of the orange-vest techs wiped a hand across his brow and squinted at the ceiling track."
TECH|"We'll need the spare coil by end of shift."
NARRATOR|"He said into his comm."
NARRATOR|"A voice crackled back—something about a manifest hold, something about a parts crawl."
NARRATOR|"The tech didn't sound worried. He sounded like a man who kept things working whether or not the parts showed up on time."
NARRATOR|"Jonah caught the tone and let it slide. People like that were why stations didn't come apart."
NARRATOR|"Their lift rose along a glass shaft that sliced through a green canyon—tiers of lettuce and beans, squash vines trained along taut lines, thin mists breathing from nozzles on a slow rhythm."
NARRATOR|"Mara pressed her palm to the glass like she could feel the leaves."
MARA|"Listen. They're watering on heartbeat."
NARRATOR|"She whispered, though the cab was quiet."
JONAH|"That's a pump cadence."
MARA|"It's a heartbeat."
NARRATOR|"She said, and he didn't argue."
NARRATOR|"Level L-3 opened onto a long corridor with intermittent windows punched into the outer wall—viewport, the map had promised, and it was right."
NARRATOR|"Earth filled each frame like a moving mural."
NARRATOR|"Jonah walked a little taller without meaning to."
NARRATOR|"He'd never admit it, but the sight reached into him and flipped some hidden switch labeled awe."
NARRATOR|"Their door read L-3, 17."
NARRATOR|"Inside: a narrow cabin, cleverly arranged."
NARRATOR|"Two bunks that could fold into a couch, a small table that could fold into a wall, a shallow locker."
NARRATOR|"The far wall was a window, and in it—Earth, immense and serene."
NARRATOR|"Mara set her purse on the table and did not sit."
NARRATOR|"She crossed the little space in two steps and braced her hands on the sill, as if the planet might drift away if she didn't hold it there."
MARA|"We live here now."
NARRATOR|"She said softly, testing the words."
JONAH|"For a week. Honeymoon rules dictate we pretend it's forever."
MARA|"That seems dangerous."
NARRATOR|"She said, but she didn't sound like she meant it."
NARRATOR|"He popped the case."
NARRATOR|"Two neatly rolled changes of clothes. A shared kit of toiletries. A vacuum-wrapped bottle of something that claimed to be champagne and probably wasn't, and two thin polymer flutes."
NARRATOR|"He lifted the bottle with a brow."
JONAH|"Smuggling offense?"
MARA|"Souvenir. From the shuttle bazaar. The label said 'Celebratory Fluid.'"
JONAH|"I feel celebrated already."
NARRATOR|"She pulled a slim roll from her purse and unfurled it on the table—pencils nested beside a small sketchbook, the paper the good kind that forgave erasing."
NARRATOR|"She sharpened a pencil with a tiny, efficient twist and flipped to a blank page."
NARRATOR|"Then she looked up and froze."
JONAH|"What?"
NARRATOR|"He said, suddenly sure he'd missed some crucial instruction on the door panel."
MARA|"Don't move. You have Earth in your eyes."
NARRATOR|"He snorted, but the sound softened."
NARRATOR|"He sat on the edge of the lower bunk and let her frame him."
NARRATOR|"The pencil moved. Quick, confident lines, a few light passes to block shape and angle."
NARRATOR|"Her hand was steady."
NARRATOR|"He watched her draw and felt that pleasant dissonance of being seen the way she saw him—cleaner at the edges, more certain around the mouth, a little heroic around the jaw."
NARRATOR|"He didn't mind."
NARRATOR|"When she looked up again, his right hand had found the ring."
NARRATOR|"He caught himself, made a fist, then relaxed it."
NARRATOR|"She noticed. She always did."
MARA|"Still round."
NARRATOR|"She said gently."
JONAH|"For now. If I work on anything mechanical this week, stop me."
MARA|"You're allowed to admire ductwork. From a distance."
NARRATOR|"He raised the bottle."
JONAH|"To distances."
MARA|"Too bleak."
NARRATOR|"She said, smiling."
JONAH|"To arriving."
NARRATOR|"He amended."
NARRATOR|"She nodded. He cracked the seal and poured."
NARRATOR|"The bubbles were overzealous and the taste landed somewhere between apple and ambition."
NARRATOR|"They laughed into their first sip."
NARRATOR|"A low chime pulsed through the cabin."
NARRATOR|"A soft text scrolled along the window's base: Maglev delay—Sector C. Minor—no action required."
NARRATOR|"The message disappeared as quickly as it came."
NARRATOR|"Another, quieter note followed: Security advisory—additional ID checks at Dock A. Expect queues."
MARA|"Vacation problem?"
JONAH|"We're not at Dock A. We're at Not-Our-Problem."
MARA|"Official station sector. Not-Our-Problem."
NARRATOR|"She said, pencil moving again."
NARRATOR|"He leaned back on his hands and watched Earth slide."
NARRATOR|"Clouds smeared like white paint across the Pacific."
NARRATOR|"Somewhere down there, his father would be closing shop, flipping a sign that had never once said 'closed' in clean lettering the way he meant it to."
NARRATOR|"Jonah swallowed and took another sip that wasn't champagne."
NARRATOR|"Mara finished the sketch—Jonah with Earth in his eyes—and tore it free along the micro-perf."
NARRATOR|"She held it up beside the window and aligned the curve of the planet across paper and glass until the horizons matched."
NARRATOR|"Then she taped it to the cabin wall with a careful square of adhesive from her kit."
MARA|"Now it's ours."
NARRATOR|"She said."
NARRATOR|"He reached for her, pulled her down beside him on the bunk."
NARRATOR|"The station hummed, steady, low, the same heartbeat she'd heard in the pumps."
NARRATOR|"He could feel the rhythm in the wall through his shoulder blade, could feel her laugh thrumming a half-beat faster where she leaned into him."
MARA|"Tomorrow, we find the upper gardens."
JONAH|"And the ductwork."
MARA|"And the ductwork."
NARRATOR|"She allowed."
NARRATOR|"The intercom pinged, polite as a knock."
PA_SYSTEM|"Welcome, Residents L-3, 17. Orientation packets have been delivered to your terminal. Please acknowledge by 0900."
NARRATOR|"The voice dissolved back into ambiance."
NARRATOR|"Mara slid the terminal from its dock and thumbed to the welcome screen."
NARRATOR|"A glossy photo of the gardens filled the display."
NARRATOR|"Beneath it, bullet points promised safety, community, efficiency."
NARRATOR|"The third line flickered—just a ripple—and settled."
MARA|"Packets later."
JONAH|"Packets later."
NARRATOR|"He agreed."
NARRATOR|"They lay back, shoulder to shoulder, the viewport framing a slow arc of Earth."
NARRATOR|"Breath by breath, the pressure of travel lifted."
NARRATOR|"Somewhere far across the curve of the planet, a research station ran simulations that decided who would live and who would die."
NARRATOR|"Here, in L-3, 17, two people listened to the hum and called it a heartbeat."
NARRATOR|"The lights slid one shade warmer as the station's lamps hit a schedule mark."
NARRATOR|"A faint whir above the ceiling, a valve somewhere clicked and closed."
NARRATOR|"The cabin made a dozen small noises of a place that worked."
NARRATOR|"Jonah's fingers found the ring again, then stopped."
NARRATOR|"He let his hand rest on the bunk between them, palm open, and felt her fingers slip into his."
JONAH|"Tomorrow."
MARA|"Tomorrow."
NARRATOR|"She echoed, and for now the word meant only gardens and windows and bad champagne that tasted like hope."
NARRATOR|"Outside, Earth turned—steady and eternal."
NARRATOR|"Inside, Europa breathed."
NARRATOR|"And life, for the moment, flowed on."
